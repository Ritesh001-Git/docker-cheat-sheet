# Docker Cheat Sheet

## Why Docker

"Docker enables developers to build portable apps in any language, using any toolchain, that run consistently across diverse environments, from local workstations to cloud and data center servers.

Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub. Docker manages and tracks changes and dependencies, making it easier for sysadmins to understand how the apps that developers build work. And with Docker Hub, developers can automate their build pipeline and share artifacts with collaborators through public or private repositories.

Docker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster." -- [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker#copy1)
