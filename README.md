# Docker Cheat Sheet

## Why Docker

"Docker enables developers to build portable apps in any language, using any toolchain, that run consistently across diverse environments, from local workstations to cloud and data center servers.

Docker Hub offers over 13,000 apps, enabling rapid development. Docker simplifies application management for sysadmins by tracking changes and dependencies. Docker Hub also allows developers to automate build pipelines and share artifacts via public or private repositories.

Docker helps developers build and ship higher-quality applications, faster." -- [What is Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker#copy1)

## Installation

### Linux

Run this quick and easy install script provided by Docker:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

If you're not willing to run a random shell script, please see the [installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) instructions for your distribution.

If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should follow the [series of tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) now.

### macOS

Download and install [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition). if you have Homebrew-Cask, just type `brew install --cask docker`. Or Download and install [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).  [Docker For Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) is nice, but it's not quite as finished as the VirtualBox install.  [See the comparison](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/).

> **NOTE** Docker Toolbox is legacy. You should to use Docker Community Edition, See [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).

Once you've installed Docker Community Edition, click the docker icon in Launchpad. Then start up a container:

```sh
docker run hello-world
```

That's it, you have a running Docker container.

If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should probably follow the [series of tutorials](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) now.
